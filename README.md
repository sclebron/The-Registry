## Description

Our task is to create a simple application that allows the Recipient to provide friends and family members with a gift registry that provides the opportunity for the Gifter to give a dollar amount gift with a credit card.  The Gifter gives their gift along with their name, email, and a message for the Receiver.   

This application will use custom databases to provide updated Gifter data, and a secure credit card processing service.
